Reflex CLI Quickstart
==================================

Getting started with Reflex is easy, and can be done in as little as 10 minutes.


Install the Reflex CLI
----------------------------------
To install the Reflex CLI just run ``pip install reflex-cli``

Generating a Reflex Configuration
----------------------------------
Now that everything is installed and configured we can get started using Reflex. The first step is to create a Reflex configuration file, which tells Reflex which measures you want to enforce in your environment. The Reflex CLI makes this easy with the ``init`` command.

Before doing this we recommend you create a new directory to store your Reflex files. ``mkdir my_reflex_measures`` to create a directory and ``cd my_reflex_measures`` to switch into it.

Run ``reflex init`` from the command line and you'll be prompted to select which measures you'd like to enforce in your environment. Proceed through the prompts, and once you're done the CLI will output a ``reflex.yaml`` configuration file in the current working directory.


Generating Terraform Modules
----------------------------------
Once you've created a ``reflex.yaml`` configuration file, you're ready to generate Terraform modules. Run ``reflex build`` to generate your Terraform modules. This will output a Terraform file for each measure you have specified in your configuration. These files will be created in a new ``reflex_out`` directory by default, but this is configurable with the ``-o`` option.

Deploy With Terraform
------------------------

Run Terraform Init
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you've generated your Terraform files, you're ready to start deploying your resources. First run ``terraform init`` from your ``reflex_out`` directory (or whatever you decided to name it). This will download all the required modules and perform all steps necessary to deploy your resources.

Run Terraform Plan (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you've generated your Terraform files and run ``terraform init`` you're ready to deploy your resources. If you want to see what resources will be deployed before you go ahead, you can run ``terraform plan`` to get a list of what resources will be added to your environment. Each measure will create multiple resources, so don't be alarmed that the number of resources being created is much larger than the number of measures you selected.

Run Terraform Apply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are ready to move forward and actually deploy your resources, go ahead and run ``terraform apply``, and Terraform will start deploying resources to your environment. As soon as it finishes running, your resources a deployed and you're done!
